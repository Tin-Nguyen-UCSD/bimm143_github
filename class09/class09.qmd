# Importing Data 
```{r}

#read.csv("candy-data.csv")
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"

```

```{r}
candy = read.csv("candy-data.csv", row.names = 1)
head(candy)
```
>Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}

nrow(candy)

```


>Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset? 

```{r}

sum(candy$fruity)

```


## What is your favorite candy?

>Q3. What is your favorite candy in the data set and wat is it's winpercent value ?

```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```

>Q4. What is the winpercent value for "KIT KAT" ?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```
>Q5. What is the winpercent value for "Tootsie Roll Snack Bars"?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```




> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

It looks like the last column 'candy$winpercent' is on a different scale to all others.


```{r}

skimr::skim(candy)

```


>Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent, breaks = 10)
```
```{r}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, fill ="blue")

```
> Q10. is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}

summary(candy$winpercent)

```




> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}

choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1

choc.candy <- candy[ choc.inds, ]

choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent

mean(choc.win)



```

```{r}
fruity.inds <- candy$fruit == 1

fruity.candy <- candy[ fruity.inds, ]

fruity.win <- fruity.candy$winpercent

mean(fruity.win)

```



> Q12. Is this difference statiscally significant?


```{r}


ans <- t.test(choc.win,fruity.win)

ans

```

Yes with a P-value of `r ans$p.value`. 

There are two related functions that can help here, one is the classic `sort()` and `order()`

```{r}

x <- c(5,10,1,4)

sort(x, decreasing = T)

```

```{r}

order(x)

```

```{r}

inds <- order( candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,],5)

```

```{r}

inds <- order(candy$winpercent, decreasing = TRUE)

tail( candy[inds,], 5)

```

> Q15.

Make a bar plot and order it by winpercent values


```{r}

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()

```

```{r}

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder( rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col()

```

```{r}

ggplot(candy) +
  aes( x=winpercent,
       y = reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent),
                   fill= chocolate)+
  geom_col()

```


Here we want a custom color vector to color each bar the way we want - with chocoalte and fruity candy together with 'chocolate' and 'fruity' candy together with whter it is a 'bar' or not



```{r}

mycols<- rep("gray",nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"

mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"

mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"



ggplot(candy) +
  aes( x=winpercent,
       y = reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent),
                   fill= chocolate)+
  geom_col(fill= mycols)

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width = 3, height = 6)

```

![My silly barplot image](mybarplot.png)
## 5. Winpercent vs pricepercent



```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
cij

corrplot(cij)
```



>Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated(i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity and negartiely correlated

```{r}
round (cij["chocolate","fruity"],2)

```


> Q23. Similarly, what two varaibles are most possitively correlated?

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We need to be sure to scale our input 'candy' data before PCA as we have the 'winpercent' column on a different scale to all others in the dataset.

```{r}

pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = T)

summary(pca)

```
First Main result figure is my "PCA plot"


```{r}

library(ggrepel)

ggplot(pca$x)+
  aes(PC1, PC2, label = rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=mycols) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlap = 1)
```
The second main PCA result is in the 'pca$rotation' we can plot this to generate a so-called "loadings" plot.

```{r}

ggplot(pca$rotation)+
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation))+
  geom_col()

```



```{r}

ggplot(pca$rotation)+
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1), fill=PC1)+
  geom_col()

```

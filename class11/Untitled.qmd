## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

We will analyze the ADK starting with a single ADk database accession code: "1ake_A"

```{r}
id <- "1ake_A"
aa <-get.seq(id)
aa

```

Now we can search the PDB database to find all related enteries. 

```{r}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)

```
```{r}
attributes(blast)


```

```{r}
head(blast$hit.tbl)


```

Make a little summary figure of these results:

```{r}

hits <- plot(blast)

```
Our "top hits" i.e. the most similar entries in the database are:

```{r}

hits$pdb.id

```

# Download related PDB files


```{r}

#Download released PDB files 
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)

```

Align and supperpose all these sturctures

```{r}



pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit=TRUE, exefile="msa")

```

side-note:

```{r}

library(bio3dview)

view.pdbs(pdbs)

```

This is better but still difficult to see what is similar and different in all these structures or indeeed learn much about how this family works.

let's try PCA:

```{r}

pc <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc)

```

```{r}

plot(pc, pc.axes = 1:2)

```

```{r}

view.pca(pc)

```

Write a PDB "trajectory" for mol-star

```{r}

mktrj(pc, file = "pca_results.pdb")

```
